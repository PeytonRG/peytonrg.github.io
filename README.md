Update 5/2/2020: Development stalled as my course load at Auburn got more intense, especially once COVID-19 threw everything off-balance, but I'm looking to resume and finish work on this site soon now that the semester has wrapped up.

5/8/20: Now that I'm working on this again at long last, I have some ideas for sections of the page that I was previously unsure about. Specifically, I'm going to completely redo the "Projects" section. I wasn't happy with how it was going before and designed myself into a corner with it. But now I have an idea, inspired by my work on another project of mine ü§ê. I'll also probably reorganize the "Technological Experience" section. It's becoming lopsided under my current dividers.
